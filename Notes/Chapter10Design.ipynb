    "\n",
    "In Chapter 9, we discuss how we can \"remove\" selection bias with assumptions. Here we demonstrate how to actually avoid bias with experimental design. \n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the classic scenario of self-reporting bias. Responders of surveys are less likely to report true status if they worry about their privacies (e.g., the \"shy\" Trump voters in recent election polls). In order to obtain true response, we can employ a randomized response technique (Warner model 1965). Let $\\pi_A$ be the sensitive proportion. With probability $p$, the question is whether you belong to set $A$; with probability $1-p$, the question is whether you belong to set $A^c$. Then we have \n",
    "\\[\n",
    "{\\rm pr}({\\rm Yes})=\\pi_A p+(1-\\pi_A)(1-p) \\ {\\rm pr}({\\rm No})=(1-\\pi_A)p+\\pi_A(1-p).\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "Hence we have $\\hat{\\pi}_A = [n_1/n-(1-p)]/(2p-1)$, which is unbiased as long as $p\\neq 0.5$. In addition, we have \n",

    "### 10.2.2 Case-control study \n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular design for observational study is the case-control study. In medical research, the cases are often easy to identify as patients' records are available from the health records. Furthermore, many diseases are rare in the general population. Therefore, rather than watching a group of participants till they develop diseases, it is more practical to select known cases and find matching control group. \n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, a case-control study identifies two populatons by the outcomes. The actual samples are drawn from the two populations, repectively. To be specific, the case group is drawn from $X, Y \\mid Y=1$, and the control group is drawn from   $X,Y \\mid Y=0$. As a result, it is no longer possible to recover the ${\\rm ACE}$ from a case-control study, as the averages are taken on wrong populaions. \n",
