    "\n",
    "In 1968 Dr. Benjamin Spock was tried in Boston for conspiring against the government for helping young men to escape the military draft. He was convicted by the Boston federal court, but the judgement was overturned by the Court of Appeals in 1969 for many reasons, one of which was cited as the bias of the presiding judge Francis Ford. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Spock, a pediatrician, was very famous for his books on rearing of children, and thus was widely admired by women. As a matter of fact, the jury in Spock trial has no women. Note that jury panels, though randomly selected, should reflect the demographics. \n",
    "\n",
    "In any particular trial, there may not be any woman on the jury, but it is worthwhile to examine if the jury panels of Judge Ford had fewer women than other judges in Boston in few months before the trial. Data are available for jury panels for 7, but we investigate the data for only 4 judges including Judge Ford. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can start our analysis with a visualization of the data set. "
