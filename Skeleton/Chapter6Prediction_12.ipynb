    "\n",
    "The tree-based method (e.g., random forest) is a popular approach for building predictive models. A tree is likely an over-simplification of the true relationship. However, it is very easy to interpret, and has a nice graphical representation: you can easily explain it to a non-statistician, and do not need a computer (or even a calculator) to get an estimate!\n",
    "\n",
    "The general steps for building a regression (or classification) tree is quite simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **stratify** (or segment) the predictor space, i.e. the set of possible values for $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p$, into {\\color{red} $J$ distinct and non-overlapping regions}, $R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_J$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the mean (regression) or mode (classification) of the response values for the training observations in region $R_j$ as the predicted response for that region.\n"

    "   The main questions in this procedure are: <span style=\"color:red\"> how should we construct the regions</span> $R_1, \\ldots, R_J$, and <span style=\"color:red\"> how many regions should we use</span>? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $J$ is known. How to construct the regions $R_1, \\ldots, R_J$?\n",
    "- Divide the predictor space into high-dimensional <span style=\"color:red\"> rectangles</span> or boxes (in theory any shape can be used, but this is simpler)\n",
    "- Find boxes $R_1, \\ldots, R_J$ that minimize the residual sum of squares\n",
