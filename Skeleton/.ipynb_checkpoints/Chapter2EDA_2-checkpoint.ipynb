    "## 2.2 Visualization\n",
    "Data visualization is an important skill to have for a data scientist. There are several tools available for data visualization. There are paid services/products offered by companies like [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) that let people generate high quality visualizations from data stored in speadsheets and databases. [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) is a Javascript library that uses a browser to display high quality, interactive graphics. Spreadsheet programs, such as Microsoft Excel, also offer visualization tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a course based on the `R` language, we will explore the visualization tools provided by the `R` language and packages. Even if we restrict ourselves to `R`, we have a few choices. The [R base graphics package](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/graphics/html/00Index.html) provides basic plotting tools that may be sufficient for many purposes. We will also look at the [ggplot2 package](http://ggplot2.org/) that offers a higher level of abstraction to create graphics. For an interesting comparison between base R graphics and ggplots, see this [blog post](https://flowingdata.com/2016/03/22/comparing-ggplot2-and-r-base-graphics/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With smartphones and computers, it is more effective than decades ago to display our findings in graphics or animations on screens. Visualization becomes one of the key tool in exploratory data analysis. We will discuss a couple basic visualization strategies using real data examples in what follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, when space is limited, we can summarize information in plots into numbers that can be reported in-line or in tables. "
