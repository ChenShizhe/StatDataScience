    "\n",
    "Data science is an interdisciplinary field. \n",
    "- It uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data.\n",
    "- It involves techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, domain knowledge and information science.\n",
    "- It is related to data mining, machine learning and big data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark** (Data science and statistics) People have very different views regarding the two terms. \n",
    "- Everyone agrees that statistics is a crucial component of data science\n",
    "- Some argued that data science is not a new field, but rather another name for statistics.\n",
    "- Some see that data science is applied statistics.\n",
    "Compared with _traditional_ statistics (e.g., in the 70s), data science \n",
    "- deals with new types of data (e.g., images, electronic health record),\n",
    "- deals with huge datasets,\n",
    "- and emphasizes prediction and action.\n",

    "We can roughly categorize tasks of a data scientist based on the schematic. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Task | Descriptions | Skills required |\n",
    "| :-: | :- | :- |\n",
    "| Visioning | To generate hypotheses or questions that are of interest  | Domain knowledge, self-learning, quantitative methods, etc. |\n",
    "| Data acquisition | To gather data for verifying hypotheses via experiments, sample surveys, or data queries | Experimental designs, causal inference, query languages, etc. |\n",
    "| Analysis | To analyze data to produce meaningful visualizations, build predictive models, test hypotheses, etc. | Domain knowledge, programming languages, statistical models, statistical theory, optimization, etc.  |\n",
    "| Conclusion | To conclude the analysis results in writing or via presentations | Communication skills, writing skills, public speaking skills, etc.  |\n",
    "| Management | To manage and oversee the project | Leadership, collaboration skills, tools for team projects, etc. |\n",

    "The transform-visualise-model step is in fact an iterative process, where we need to reflect and revise our approaches based on results in previous steps. \n",
