    "\n",
    "We have discussed in Section 9.2 that, in an observational study, the expected difference between the treatment and control group does not equal to the average causal effects (ACE). We can take a closer look at the difference (i.e., bias)\n",

    "To remove the bias, one common assumption in the literature is known as the ignorability assumption. Roughtly, the ignorability assumption imposes that, with covariates $X_i$, units are more homegeneous in the outcome distribitions, i.e.,\n",

    "Formally, the ignorability assumption states that $Z_i \\perp Y_i(Z) | X_i$ for $Z=0,1$. This is also known as uncounfoundedness, exogeneity, selection on observables. \n",

    "In addition to the ignorability assumption, we need a few more assumptions to identify the ACE in an observational study. The assumptions are as follows. \n",
