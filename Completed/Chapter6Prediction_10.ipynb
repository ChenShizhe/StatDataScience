    "Rather than constraining the complexity, we can directly deal with overfitting. The issue of overfitting is when the model over fits the random patterns in the data set, where these patterns will not be seen in the new observations. A straight-forward way to address this issue is to employ **independent Validation**. That is, the chosen criterion will be evaluated on an independent testing set, where the model is trained on a training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we may not be able to collect a new set of data from the same population using the same sampling scheme. However, we can create the training-test sets from one data set. We can *randomly* split the data set into two sets, where $q\\%$ of the data belong to the training set and $(1-q)\\%$ the test set. When the split is random, it is reasonable to believe that the two sets share the same data generating mechanism. The split needs some careful thoughts when there are structures in the data (e.g., time series data). \n",
