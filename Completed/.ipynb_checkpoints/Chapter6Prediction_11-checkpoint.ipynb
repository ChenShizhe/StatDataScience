    "The split-sample validation does not seem an efficient use of the data set. Only part of the data is used in training the model, and the other part produces estimates of the criterion with low precision due to limited sample size. \n",
    "\n",
    "How about \"rotating\" the roles of training and validation? For instance, we can split the data equally into two sets. We train the model on Set 1 and evaluate the fitted model on Set 2. Then, we train the model on Set 2 and evaluate the fitted model on Set 1. This way, all data are used at least once in fitting a model, and once in evaluating the model fitted from other data. In both cases, overfitting is curbed since training and validation happen on independent data sets. This procedure is known as **cross-validation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the $K$-fold cross-validation works as follows. We randomly partition our data into $K$ non-overlapping sets, a.k.a. folds. Suppose that there are $K$ folds. Each time, we then use $1$ fold as the test set, and all $K-1$ folds as the training set. After iterating through all $K$ folds, we use the average criterion (e.g., loss function) from the $K$ iterations as the final performance measure of the procedure. We will pick the procedure with the best performance and refit the procedure on the full data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "A special case of cross-validation is the leave-one-out validation, where 1 observation is left out as the test set each time. "
