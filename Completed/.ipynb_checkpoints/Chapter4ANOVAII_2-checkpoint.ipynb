    "Very often you may see an additive model $Y_{ijk} = \\mu_{\\cdot\\cdot} + \\alpha_i+\\beta_j + \\epsilon_{ijk}$, where the interactions $\\{(\\alpha\\beta)_{ij}\\}$ are dropped. Dropping the interaction terms reduces the number of unknown parameters to estimate, which improves efficiency if the reduced model does not fall too far away from the truth. However, a reduced model places additional assumptions which may not be true in the real world. In practice, we need to carefully decide the form of model based on, but not limited to, background, questions of interest, prior knowledge, exploratory analysis, etc. "
