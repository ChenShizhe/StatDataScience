    "Suppose that we are interested in predicting an <span style=\"color:red\"> outcome, $y$,</span> using a set of features ${\\bf  x}= (x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_p)^T$. In other words, we want to learn a function $f\\left({\\bf x},\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\right)$ that predicts $y$, where the function $f$ is indexed by a vector of parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\equiv \\left(\\beta_1,\\ldots, \\beta_p\\right)$. The hope is that, for any new observation ${\\bf x}^*= (x_1^*, x_2^*,\\ldots, x_p^*)^T$, we can predict its outcome $y^*$ with $f({\\bf x}^*,\\boldsymbol{\\beta})$.  To this end, we need to find the **best** $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ for predicting our data. In other words, we search for the vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ that minimizes $\\mathbb{E}\\left[L\\left(y,  f\\left({\\bf x},\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\right) \\right)\\right]$, where $L(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is the loss function or criterion of interest.
